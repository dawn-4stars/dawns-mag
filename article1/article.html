            Throughout most of my childhood, I was considered by a good number of my peers as the reputed "weird" kid. To be fair, I don't think I'd be able to fully deny this label no matter how hard I try. Community was always a door I had a hard time walking through. The jag of my keys happened to be slightly wrong and the hinges not only squeak, they are off kilter, drag, and twist improperly in places. The difficulty of this push often prevents me from decidedly arriving at the other side of door. I often gave up before I even started. 
            <br><br>
            It did not help that reading the room was not at all my forte. Each room I walked into was magically populated by Hebrew speakers and I had to make inferences based on every passing syllable and minute gesture. "What was that face they just made?" It was neverending guesswork and I got most of it wrong. In the rare occasion that I did get it right, I would soon realize just how bad I was with crowd work and bonding. 
            <br><br>
            I played an assortment of strange and paradoxical archetypes growing up. I was the boyish, lanky, dissenting schoolgirl who held disgusting irreverence towards her catholic education, but at the same time who mentioned at an obnoxious rate her love for educated figures like Descartes, Napoleon and Nietzsche. I was correcting everybody's grammar, I refused to be hugged, and I never really figured out what to do with my hair. It was hard to love me unless you really understood where I was coming from -- but then again it was really hard to understand where I was coming from.
            <br><br>
            I had no siblings up until the midpoint of my teenage years (even when I did get my first brother, he lived with my mom in a faraway household). My dad sort of took on the role of a single father -- not really how he would put it, but I think it's only right. He taught me all that I know. It's funny because I used to curse my dad for imparting his interests and his neurosis unto me. His love of books, old racing  games, heated intellectual discussions, dark humor, full-of-talk chess sessions. His infamous talent for the solitary act of writing. His stony manliness, his certain emotional irregularities. The likes.
            <br><br>
            There was this one time in elementary, upon learning that my dad used to be a writer for newspapers and magazines, my English teacher invited him to give a talk about journalism to the aspiring writers of my batch. I don't think my classmates were really paying attention to him, too distracted by the fact that he was my dad. After his now-forgotten informal lecture, my classmates would go on to tell me that no one could mistake him as someone who was not my dad. We are very much alike, is what I am trying to say. Scarily alike.
            <br><br>
            At home, there was really no impulse or need to connect with other people because that part of me that longed for love and understanding was being satisfied by the attention and the kindness that my dad and my grandmother were giving me. And there was not yet a rich, complex, fleshed out inner self that required much translation or mangling. I was simply satisfied. And because I was so simply satisfied and so used to spending my downtime by myself, I found it exteremely hard to make friends and to form a deep-rooted connection with other people. The few fiends I did make, I kept feeling like I didn't wholly understand them which, consequently, made it hard to be their true confidant and true confessor. 
            <br><br>
            I brought this unfortunate trait with me even as I entered high school. I met more people this time but something was still constitutionally wrong with me. I still could not sustain a long-term bond unlike most of my peers who grouped themselves up with relative ease. Even the people I felt close to, the people I confided in semi-regularly, the people whose confessions I listened to with great patience and interest -- they all seemed to have people closer to them. Groups were always walking ahead of me. I was not really anyone's best friend. As I started to get a closer look myself, I realized I was growing incessantly lonely. And I think everyone around me could sense the desperation and anxiety that lay past my quippy and quirky exterior. The interrupting pandemic only made things worse for me, as a non-fan of beyond-instantaneous electronic messaging.
            <br><br>
            Thankfully and miraculously, things took a turn when offline classes reopened. I was back on campus with people who were dying to be in the presence of others. And everyone was in the same daze that I was in, the same rustiness, that weird unfamiliarity with the whole ordeal of being with other people. This was the year I really learned that everybody has to work in order to reap the fruits of human connection. Here I thought "why am I the only one who finds this shit hard?" when in fact I was overlooking all the hard work that other people have put into being in community with each other. This was the year I realized what a beautiful industry it is to spend time, to drink, to eat, to gossip, to walk, to do everything, to do nothing with people. I made actual friends, I placed myself in the sights of interesting and wise professors. I was in the rooftops, pools, beds, chairs, tables of many peers. 
            <br><br>
            As soon as college came I found myself missing that Year of Enlightenment and Friendship, almost passionately angry that I was ripped apart from that community before I could see it culminate into anything grand. I wanted to see the days leading to each of our great escapes from the prison of being nineteen. I wanted to roam those halls forever, stand around waiting for those buses forever, window shop in malls forver, be in those calls forever.
            <br><br>
            Now, in my second-ish year of college, I feel like crying when I look at the pictures we took. I worry about all the seconds I might have lost trying to be cool, obscuring my eyes as I adjusted strands of my hair, looking down as I smoothed the tuck of my shirt, retying my laces, looking at my watch, grimacing at the oily cafeteria food. I should have used all that time to take a longer look at what was around me. I should have soaked it all in. I should have paid more attention. And I should have taken way, way more pictures.
            <br><br>
            I don't think I can really put into perspective just how I felt looking at those snapshots of an earlier life. Not quite enough to call it nostalgia. Is it wrong to say it depresses me that I will never come across a connection like that in my life? Is it an overreaction? That was the kind of sublime connection that could only come from people who are equally confused, equally brimming with vision and wisdom, equally different from each other and yet equally all the same. In my head I am picturing it as a kind of colored light refracting off of mirrors, brightening everything in its path. I am afraid to say it, but that was the kind of light that I may never witness again -- but then I remember: to have seen it once is to see it forever.
            <br><br>
            I can't ever know what kind of person I would be without them. But I know that they are the reason I am not as scared anymore to strike up conversation with passing strangers, to talk boldly in a room, to volunteer, to share passionately about a common interest. If not for these people I would never know how to actually cross the street, to hold my breath when taking my liquour, to compute for the standard deviation in a table, to be a girl, to be a tolerable boy, to sit in comfortable silence, to make so much noise.
            <br><br>
            I guess this is beginning to sound like a full-of-sap thank-you letter rather than an essay/article but I cannot really bring myself to be all contrite about it. I have learned the hard way that to arrive at love and true respect, we have to say what we really want to say even when we would rather hold off on it. I will say now: I hope to still see my friends' faces when I am old. I know they will not be the exact same faces or the exact same list, but in my heart I store an imprint of the immortal eyes of these people that I once loved and will hold dear forever.
